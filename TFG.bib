abstract = {We present a linear-time subspace clustering approach that combines sparse representations and bipartite graph modeling. The signals are modeled as drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, and each signal is represented by a sparse combination of basis elements, termed atoms, which form the columns of a dictionary matrix. The sparse representation coefficients are arranged in a sparse affinity matrix, which defines a bipartite graph of two disjoint sets: 1) atoms and 2) signals. Subspace clustering is obtained by applying low-complexity spectral bipartite graph clustering that exploits the small number of atoms for complexity reduction. The complexity of the proposed approach is linear in the number of signals, thus it can rapidly cluster very large data collections. Performance evaluation of face clustering and temporal video segmentation demonstrates comparable clustering accuracies to state-of-the-art at a significantly lower computational load.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is a multivariate method used in many fields in order to group a population of objects based on a set of computed variables into a number of different groups, so that similar objects be assigned to the same group. Discriminant analysis represents a technique of supervised recognition of forms used to determine which variables are the best predictors of the classification of objects belonging to a population into predetermined clusters. In this paper we will use discriminant analysis to classify the insurance companies that operated on the Romanian insurance market in 2012, taking in consideration a number of eight variables which are highly relevant for this industry. Before proceeding to discriminant analysis, we performed cluster analysis on the original data in order to identify classes that result from the data.},

In this work, a hybrid clustering algorithm for K-Means called Optimized K-Means with firefly and canopies, has been proposed by integration of two meta-heuristic algorithms: Firefly algorithm and Canopy pre-clustering algorithm. The result model has been applied for classification of breast cancer data. Haberman’s survival dataset from UCI machine learning repository is used as the benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of the proposed integrated clustering framework. The experimental result shows that the proposed optimized KMeans with firefly and canopies model outperforms traditional K-Means algorithm in terms of classification accuracy and therefore can be used for better breast cancer diagnosis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify academically at-risk students in first-semester general chemistry using affective characteristics via cluster analysis. Through the clustering of six preselected affective variables, three distinct affective groups were identified: low (at-risk), medium, and high. Students in the low affective group reported lower scores on intellectual accessibility, emotional satisfaction, math self-concept, chemistry self-concept, and self-efficacy and a higher score on test anxiety. Significant differences were found on exam performance between the high and low affective groups with the high affective group performing significantly better than the low affective group. In terms of value beliefs, expectancy beliefs, and metacognitive self-regulation, differences were found between the high and low groups as well. These findings provide instructors an efficient way of identifying and reaching out to at-risk students early in the semester, as well as gaining a better understanding of the affective profile found in general chemistry.},

abstract = {Terahertz imaging is a novel imaging modality that has been used with great potential in many applications. Due to its specific properties, the segmentation of this type of images makes possible the discrimination of diverse regions within a sample. Among many segmentation methods, k-means clustering is considered as one of the most popular techniques. However, it is known that k-means is especially sensitive to initial starting centers. In this paper, we propose an original version of k-means for the segmentation of Terahertz images, called ranked-k-means, which is essentially less sensitive to the initialization of the centers. We present the ranked set sampling design and explain how to reformulate the k-means technique under the ranked sample to estimate the expected centers as well as the clustering of the observed data. Our clustering approach is tested on various real Terahertz images. Experimental results show that k-means clustering based on ranked set sampling is more efficient than other clustering techniques such as the k-means based on the fundamental sampling design simple random sampling technique, the standard k-means and the k-means based on the Bradley refinement of initial centers.

@article{Zelnik-manor2004,
abstract = {We study a number of open issues in spectral clustering: (i) Selecting the appropriate scale of analysis, (ii) Handling multi-scale data, (iii) Clustering with irregular background clutter, and, (iv) Finding automatically the number of groups. We first propose that a ‘local ’ scale should be used to compute the affinity between each pair of points. This local scaling leads to better clustering especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background. We further suggest exploiting the structure of the eigenvectors to infer automatically the number of groups. This leads to a new algorithm in which the final randomly initialized k-means stage is eliminated. 1},

abstract = {Background: Flow cytometry produces large multi-dimensional datasets of the physical and molecular characteristics of individual cells. The objective of this study was to simplify the cytometry datasets by arranging or clustering "objects" (cells) into a smaller number of relatively homogeneous groups (clusters) on the basis of interobject similarities and dissimilarities. Results: The algorithm was designed to be driven by histogram features; that is, the relevant single parameter histogram features were used to guide multidimensional k-means clustering without an a priori estimate of cluster number. To test this approach, we simulated cell-derived datasets using protein-coated microspheres (artificial "cells"). The microspheres were constructed to provide 119 populations in 40 samples. The feature-guided (FG) approach accurately identified 100\% of the predetermined cluster combinations. In contrast, an approach based on the partition index (PI) cluster validity measure accurately identified 83.2\% of the clusters. Direct comparisons of the two methods indicated that the FG method was significantly more accurate than PI in identifying both the number of clusters and the number of objects within the clusters (p < .0001). Conclusion: We conclude that parameter feature analysis can be used to effectively guide k-means clustering of flow cytometry datasets. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cortes2007,
abstract = {Cluster analysis, a classification technique used to group data in many fields, is developed here as a tool to study magma mixing and mixed crystal populations in volcanic rocks. The method is based on the quantification of the chemical degree of similarity among populations of mineral chemistry data, which allows identification of discrete clusters. In order to apply the technique for the particular problem of mixed crystal populations, the mineral chemistry of a given crystalline phase is represented by a vector with "n" coordinates, in which each coordinate is a real number that represents the amount of a given component in cations per formula unit present in the phase. These vectors are in a set, which is a subset of Rn, the real vector space of n dimensions. Because mineral chemistry data are a particular case of compositional data (i.e. the components sum to a constant value, usually 100\% or the numbers of cations per formula unit), the conventional Euclidean distance cannot be used to quantify how similar the data are, in order to apply cluster analysis. To avoid this predicament, Aitchison's metric is proposed to measure similarities instead. Here, average linkage, a hierarchical clustering technique, combined with the Aitchison metric and stoichiometrical constraints, is applied to mineral chemistry data. This approach is evaluated using well-characterized lava samples from the Vancori period of activity (26-13.8 ky) of Stromboli volcano, Italy, in which magma mixing has been identified between a basaltic andesite-latite, hosted in the magma chamber and a less evolved basaltic recharge magma. The results are in agreement with previous interpretations of magma mixing, which validates the use of the cluster analysis technique in the context of magma mixing relationships, and opens the possibility to expand this methodology to other aspects of igneous petrology. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This work aimed to establish an innovative approach to evaluate the effect of cereals composition on ochratoxin A extraction by multivariate analysis. Principal components analysis was applied to identify the effect of major matrix components on the recovery of ochratoxin A by QuEChERS method using HPTLC and HPLC, and to validate the method for ochratoxin A determination in wheat flour by HPLC. The matrices rice bran, wheat bran and wheat flour were characterized for their physical and chemical attributes. The ochratoxin A recovery in these matrices was highly influenced (R = 0.99) by the sugar content of the matrix, while the lipids content showed a minor interference (R = 0.29). From these data, the QuEChERS method was standardized for extracting ochratoxin A from flour using 1\% ACN:water (2:1) as extraction solvent and dried magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride as salts. The recovery values ranged from 97.6\% to 105\%. The validated method was applied to evaluate natural occurrence of ochratoxin A in 20 wheat flour samples, which were contaminated with ochratoxin A levels in the range of 0.22-0.85 $\mu$g kg-1.},

abstract = {Market segmentation is a very popular marketing tool. In the food sector, the characteristics of different consumer attitudes and consumption habits are often used as the basis for segmentation. However, the success of a target-oriented marketing approach to selected groups of consumers depends on the results of the methodology applied. So far, relatively little attention has been paid to the reliability of the analysis used for attitude-based market segmentation, to the validity or internal stability of results or to the dynamic stability over time with regard to number, size and properties of the segments. In our study, we used data from a panel of more than 10,000 German households. The participants were segmented using a statement battery and the application of cluster analysis. In order to ensure an internally stable cluster solution, our focus was on the analytical and technical process of decision making when clustering a large dataset. A combination of various statistical measures was applied in order to enable objective decision making in the determination of the optimal number of clusters. The dynamic stability of the resulting segments was determined by confirmatory cluster analyses using data from the same individuals in three subsequent years.The results of the analyses show that neither the internal nor the dynamic stability of market segments should be taken for granted. Therefore, marketers face the challenge of designing segment-specific marketing strategies in a way that allows changes in consumer preferences to be integrated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
